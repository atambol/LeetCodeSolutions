## Linked List
* Add a dummy head node to the front to avoid explicitly handling edge cases
* Fast pointer and slow pointer technique
* Check for empty list

## Trees
* Iterative - use explicit stacks to store state - faster but trciky
* Recursive - use internal function call stack - slower but easy - think about what to handle on one node
* Check for empty tree node

## Strings
* Check case sensitivity
* Check encoding

## Arrays
* two pointer technique (i = 0, j = n-1)
